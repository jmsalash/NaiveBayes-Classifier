# NaiveBayes-Classifier

Homework for the Machine Learning lecture, part of the MSc AI and Robotics in Sapienza University of Rome.

Exercise2.java: Single Java class that implements Bernoulli and Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier.

Originally developed as a ham/spam classifier for the UCI SMS Spam collection dataset.

During the Machine Learning lecture, the class was modified to accept any number of classes, but still following the UCI SMS Spam collection dataset csv format.

K-fold cross validation is also implemented in Java, rather than using external libraries for dataset preparation.
